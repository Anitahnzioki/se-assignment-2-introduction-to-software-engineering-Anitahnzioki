# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: its a branch that involves designing, developing, mantaining and evaluating sofware systems to as to meet the needs of the users and the real world.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? software engineering majorly deals with developing and mantaining intangible software systems allowing flexibility i.e users can always give feedback for improvements to be done  while traditional engineering deals with the tangible software sysytems and more fixed processes i.e the process is linear and designs are made on earlier stages
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): this is the process of developing software that ensures high quality and effiecient results. its cost and time effective in order to ensure minimization os any risk.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.1.Planning stage involves defining the goals and objectives, allocating the resources that will be used, and coming up with a project plan and schedule. 2.Requirement analysis stage involves getting more details abouth the proect and getting approval from the ones involved. 3.Design stage is about coming up with data models and database designs. deisning user interface and system components.4.Implementation stage is coding where one wites down the codes and follows the guidelines and also intregrates different modules.5.Testing stage is doing all the testing on the system,unit,intergation and acceptance and incase of anyissues and bugs they are fixedso as to ensure quality production.6. Deployment stage is now installing and configuring the software, conducting the user training and support in the software.7. Maintanance is the last stage where provision of support and bug fixes happens,implementation updates and monitoring sysytem performance and security is done.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile is incremental approach to prjoect management and software development while Waterfall is linera and subsequential approach where ecah phase must be completed before next phase.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Agile has quick responses to changes since there is  regular feedback from clients while Waterfall is difficult to take changes because it is rigid and testing occurs at a late stage. Howeever,Both  can be easy to manage and can easen the work of project planners. 
Requirements Engineering: it is a stage in SDLC that idntifies, documents and manages needs and requirements of stakeholders for software development.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.1.Requiremnt Elicitation is the first stage and it involves coolection of information from stakeholders through interviews, questionnaires and indentying their needs.2.Reqiurement Analysis involves analysing the information gathered amd prioritizing what is needed depending on the most imoprtant.3.Reqquirement Specialization classifying the reuirements cleary and being as precise as possible.4.Requirements Validation invloves verifucation of the requirements to meet the needs of the staakeholders, ensuring consistency,testing and completion then geeting approvalfrom the stake holders.5. Requirements Management is the last stage and it involves mantain it and keeping track of any changes throughout the project due to the evolving needs of the stakeholders or challenges ij the project
Software Design Principles: These are guidelines and best practices that are used to create software that is mantainable and efficient

Explain the concept of modularity in software design.  How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
